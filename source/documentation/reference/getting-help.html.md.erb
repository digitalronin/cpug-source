## Slack Channel

The quickest way to get help is to post a question in the
[#ask-cloud-platform] Slack channel.

## Raise a support ticket

You can [raise a support ticket][support-ticket] as an issue
on our GitHub repository.

## Open (half) Hours

If you want to discuss anything relating to the cloud platform, whether that's
learning about general concepts or digging into specific questions, you can
book a slot to discuss your issues with a member of the Cloud Platform team.

Sessions are open to anyone, and can cover any topic related to the Cloud
Platform.

To book a 30 minute slot, please post to [#ask-cloud-platform]
