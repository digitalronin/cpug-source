### Overview

The Cloud Platform automatically collects and stores your application logs, and lets you access them via an AWS-Hosted Kibana dashboard.

Logs are collected via [Fluentd][fluentd], and stored in an AWS-Hosted [ElasticSearch Cluster][elasticsearch].

### Log Collection

Fluentd is a cluster-wide log collection service.

The Fluentd application is configured with cluster-wide read permissions. The only requirement for Fluentd to start automatically collecting your application's logs is to have your application output logs to `stdout`.

### Log Storage

The logs are shipped from Fluentd and stored in an AWS-Hosted ElasticSearch cluster. All application logs are retained for 30 days.
